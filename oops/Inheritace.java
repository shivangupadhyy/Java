/*
Code Explanation:
- The 'base' class defines a field and methods for x.
- The 'Derived' class extends 'base', inheriting its fields and methods, and adds its own field y.
- In main, you can create objects of both classes. The derived class object can use both base and derived class methods.
- This demonstrates the concept of inheritance in Java, which promotes code reuse and logical hierarchy.


Java Inheritance â€“ Key Notes

Inheritance Basics:

Inheritance allows a class (child/derived) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent/base).
The Derived class extends the base class, so it inherits all fields and methods of base.
Base Class (base):

Contains an integer field x.
Provides getter (getX) and setter (setX) methods for x, with print statements to show when they're called.
Has a method printMe() to demonstrate a method in the base class.
Derived Class (Derived):

Inherits all members of base.
Adds its own field y with getter (getY) and setter (setY) methods.
Object Creation:

You can create an object of the base class and use its methods.
You can create an object of the derived class, which can use both its own methods and those inherited from the base class.
Usage Example:

Derived d = new Derived();
d.setX(4); // Inherited from base
System.out.println(d.getX()); // Inherited from base
d.setY(10); // Defined in Derived
System.out.println(d.getY()); // Defined in Derived
Takeaway:

Inheritance promotes code reuse and logical hierarchy.
The derived class can use and override base class methods.
Constructors are not inherited, but the derived class can call the base class constructor.
