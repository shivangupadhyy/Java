/*
Notes for Better Understanding:
- Interfaces in Java define a contract (set of methods) that implementing classes must fulfill.
- All fields in interfaces are public, static, and final by default (constants).
- All methods in interfaces are abstract (unless default/static methods in Java 8+).
- A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance of type.
- You cannot instantiate an interface directly, but you can reference an object via its interface type.
- Interface variables cannot be changed (they are final constants).
- Implementing classes must provide concrete implementations for all interface methods.
- This example shows a class implementing two interfaces and providing all required methods.

/*Multiple inheritance (a class inheriting from more than one class) is not supported in Java to avoid ambiguity and complexity, especially the "Diamond Problem."

Diamond Problem Example:
If two parent classes have a method with the same name, and a child class inherits from both, the compiler cannot decide which method to use. This leads to ambiguity.

Javaâ€™s Solution:

Java allows multiple inheritance of type through interfaces, not classes.
A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can only extend one class.
This keeps the language simple, avoids ambiguity, and makes code easier to maintain.
Summary:
Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java to prevent confusion and errors from ambiguous method inheritance. Interfaces provide a safe way to achieve similar flexibility. */
